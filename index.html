<h1>This a heading 1 element</h1>

<p>
This is the start of a really short paragraph. It has some other nested tags to emphasise/highlight some of the text. For example:
<strong>This is bold text.</strong>
And, even more exciting:
<em>This is italic text!</em>
</p>

<p>
This is a paragraph explaining the image below.
Remember: images use a self-closing tag, and the image URL is set by the "src" attribute.

<h3>This is a subheadline wrapped in "h3" tags.</h3>

<p>
If we have a URL like the one at the end of this paragraph then it should be hyperlinked using the correct tag:
<a href="https://www.google.com.au">https://www.google.com.au</a>
</p>

<p>Please wrap my favourite YouTube video below in the correct tag</p>

As a last favour, please use an image tag with a src attribute to display the Gif below.
Refer to the example image above as a hint for the correct tag and structure
